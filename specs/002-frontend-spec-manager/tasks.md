# Implementation Tasks: Frontend Specifications for Todo Web Application

**Feature**: Frontend Specifications for Todo Web Application
**Branch**: 002-frontend-spec-manager
**Generated**: 2026-01-08
**Input**: spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-contract.md

## Overview

Implementation of a Next.js 16+ frontend application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui components for a multi-user todo application. The frontend will integrate with Better Auth for authentication, implement JWT-based security, and provide a responsive, mobile-first UI with task management capabilities.

## Dependencies

- Backend API must be available with `/api/{user_id}/tasks/*` endpoints
- Better Auth configured with shared `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- Neon PostgreSQL database with user and task tables

## Parallel Execution

Tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel if they modify different files or non-interdependent components.

**Example Parallel Tasks**:
- T015 [P] [US1] Create login form component
- T016 [P] [US1] Create signup form component
- T025 [P] [US2] Create task card component
- T026 [P] [US2] Create task list component

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: User Authentication and Login (US1) + Task Management Dashboard (US2)
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story provides independent value
3. **Test Early**: Implement error handling and loading states alongside core functionality
