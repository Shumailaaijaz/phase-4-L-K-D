# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a Next.js 16+ frontend application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui components for a multi-user todo application. The frontend will integrate with Better Auth for authentication, implement JWT-based security, and provide a responsive, mobile-first UI with task management capabilities. The application will enforce strict user isolation by using authenticated user_id in all API calls to the backend endpoints.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Next.js 16+ with App Router)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Better Auth, Sonner, Lucide React
**Storage**: N/A (frontend only - data storage handled by backend API)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library (to be determined in later phases)
**Target Platform**: Web browser (mobile, tablet, desktop)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend component of full-stack application)
**Performance Goals**: <2s dashboard load time for up to 100 tasks, responsive UI with 60fps interactions
**Constraints**: Must integrate with backend API at `/api/{user_id}/tasks/*` endpoints, JWT authentication required, strict user isolation
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page application for task management, responsive design for all screen sizes

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Spec-Driven Development Compliance**: All UI components and frontend logic must be specified in markdown files before implementation
2. **Multi-user Isolation**: Frontend must enforce user isolation by using authenticated user_id in API calls
3. **Authentication Integration**: Must integrate with Better Auth for session management and JWT handling
4. **API Contract Compliance**: Must use exact API endpoints as specified: `/api/{user_id}/tasks/*` with proper JWT headers
5. **Responsive Design**: Must implement mobile-first responsive design for all components
6. **Authorization Headers**: All API calls must include JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` format
7. **Error Handling**: Must handle 401, 403, 404 errors as specified in constitution with `{ "error": string }` format

```

**Structure Decision**: Selected Option 2 (Web application) with frontend-only structure following Next.js 16+ App Router conventions. The frontend will be located in the root of the project for simplicity, with all UI components, pages, and services organized in a clean, scalable structure.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
