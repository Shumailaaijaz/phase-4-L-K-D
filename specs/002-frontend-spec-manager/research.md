# Research Summary: Frontend Specifications for Todo Web Application

## Completed Research Items

### 1. Next.js Implementation Approach
**Decision**: Use Next.js 16+ with App Router for the frontend implementation
**Rationale**: Next.js App Router provides the best developer experience for building full-stack applications with integrated data fetching, server components, and client components
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pages Router (legacy, not preferred for new projects)
- Other frameworks like React + Vite (lacks integrated routing and SSR capabilities)

### 2. Authentication Integration
**Decision**: Integrate Better Auth for complete authentication solution
**Rationale**: Better Auth provides comprehensive authentication solution with JWT support, session management, and easy integration with Next.js
**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation (more complex, error-prone)
- Other providers like Clerk (vendor lock-in concerns)

### 3. Styling and UI Components
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling with Shadcn/ui component library
**Rationale**: Provides utility-first CSS approach with pre-built accessible components that can be customized to match the design system
**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS Modules (less flexible)
- Styled-components (adds complexity)

### 4. API Client Strategy
**Decision**: Implement centralized API client with automatic JWT header injection
**Rationale**: Ensures consistent API interaction patterns and centralized error handling across the application
**Alternatives considered**:
- Multiple ad-hoc fetch calls (leads to inconsistency)
- Third-party libraries like Axios (additional dependency overhead)

### 5. State Management
**Decision**: Use React state for UI state with SWR or React Query for server state
**Rationale**: Modern data fetching libraries provide excellent caching, synchronization, and optimistic updates
**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux (overkill for this application size)
- Context API alone (requires more boilerplate)

### 6. Responsive Design Approach
**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind's responsive utility classes
**Rationale**: Follows modern best practices and leverages Tailwind's built-in responsive design capabilities
**Breakpoints**:
- Mobile: 320px and up
- Tablet: 768px and up
- Desktop: 1200px and up

### 7. Form Handling and Validation
**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
**Rationale**: Provides excellent TypeScript support and declarative validation
**Alternatives considered**:
- Formik (heavier bundle)
- Native HTML5 validation (limited flexibility)

### 8. Toast Notifications
**Decision**: Use Sonner for toast notifications
**Rationale**: Modern, accessible, and customizable toast library with good performance
**Alternatives considered**:
- react-toastify (older, less performant)
- Custom implementation (unnecessary complexity)

### 9. Icons Strategy
**Decision**: Use Lucide React for iconography
**Rationale**: Consistent, accessible, and lightweight icon library with good design
**Alternatives considered**:
- Radix Icons (limited selection)
- Custom SVGs (maintenance overhead)

### 10. Protected Routes Implementation
**Decision**: Implement Next.js middleware for route protection
**Rationale**: Provides server-side route protection before component rendering
**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side protection (security risk)
- Higher-order components (more complex)
