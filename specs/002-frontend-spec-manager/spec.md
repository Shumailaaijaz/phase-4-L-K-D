# Feature Specification: Frontend Specifications for Todo Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-frontend-spec-manager`
**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Generate complete frontend specifications for Phase II Full-Stack Todo Web Application. Focus exclusively on frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components, Better Auth integration, fully responsive mobile-first design."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - User Authentication and Login (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to be able to securely log into the Todo application so I can access my personal tasks. I should be able to sign in with my email and password, receive appropriate error messages for invalid credentials, and be redirected to the dashboard upon successful authentication.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational requirement for any user-specific application - without authentication, users cannot access their personal data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to log in with valid credentials and verifying access to the dashboard, delivering secure user access to personal data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has valid credentials, **When** user enters email and password and clicks login, **Then** user is authenticated and redirected to dashboard
2. **Given** user has invalid credentials, **When** user enters incorrect email/password and clicks login, **Then** appropriate error message is displayed without access to dashboard

### User Story 2 - Task Management Dashboard (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to view my tasks in an organized, visually appealing dashboard so I can efficiently manage my to-dos. I should see all my tasks in card format with options to mark complete, edit, or delete.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that users expect from a todo application - the ability to see and manage their tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks and verifying they appear in the dashboard with proper UI elements, delivering core task management functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is authenticated with existing tasks, **When** user visits dashboard, **Then** all tasks are displayed in an organized, responsive layout
2. **Given** user has no tasks, **When** user visits dashboard, **Then** appropriate empty state is shown with clear call-to-action

---

### User Story 3 - Task CRUD Operations (Priority: P2)

As an authenticated user, I want to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete through an intuitive interface so I can fully manage my todo items. The interface should provide forms for adding/editing tasks with validation and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.

**Why this priority**: These are the essential CRUD operations that make the todo application functional beyond just viewing tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing each CRUD operation and verifying the UI updates appropriately, delivering complete task management capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on dashboard, **When** user clicks add task button, **Then** modal form opens with required fields for task creation
2. **Given** user has a task to edit, **When** user clicks edit icon, **Then** modal form opens pre-filled with task data for modification

---

### User Story 4 - Responsive Mobile Experience (Priority: P2)

As a user accessing the application from various devices, I want the interface to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes so I can manage my tasks effectively on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**Why this priority**: With mobile-first usage patterns, responsive design is essential for user adoption and satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the application on different screen sizes and verifying layout adaptation, delivering consistent user experience across devices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses application on mobile device, **When** user interacts with UI elements, **Then** interface adapts to mobile constraints with appropriate touch targets and layout
2. **Given** user switches between mobile and desktop views, **When** viewport changes, **Then** layout and components adjust appropriately

---

### User Story 5 - Dark Mode Support (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark color schemes so I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

**Why this priority**: While not essential for core functionality, dark mode is an expected feature in modern applications that enhances user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling the theme and verifying all UI elements adapt appropriately, delivering enhanced visual comfort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application is in light mode, **When** user toggles dark mode, **Then** all UI elements switch to dark theme with appropriate contrast

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user attempts to access dashboard without authentication?
- How does system handle network failures during API calls?
- What occurs when user tries to create a task with empty title?
- How does UI behave when there are many tasks to display?
- What happens when JWT token expires during session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide user authentication via email and password with Better Auth integration
- **FR-002**: System MUST display user's tasks in a responsive, card-based dashboard layout
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to create, read, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete through the UI
- **FR-004**: System MUST support responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement dark/light mode toggle with persistent user preference
- **FR-006**: System MUST display appropriate loading states and error messages during API operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide form validation for all user input fields
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- **FR-009**: System MUST support keyboard navigation for accessibility
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide smooth transitions and polished UI interactions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents the authenticated user with session management and JWT token
- **Task**: Represents a todo item with properties like title, description, completion status, and timestamps

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can authenticate and access dashboard within 30 seconds of opening the application
- **SC-002**: Dashboard loads and displays tasks within 2 seconds for up to 100 tasks
- **SC-003**: All UI elements are responsive and usable across mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px+) screen sizes
- **SC-004**: 95% of user interactions result in appropriate feedback (success, error, or loading states)
- **SC-005**: All forms provide clear validation feedback and prevent submission of invalid data
