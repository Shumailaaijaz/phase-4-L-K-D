# Implementation Tasks: Backend API Implementation

## Feature Overview
Secure, production-ready FastAPI backend with Neon PostgreSQL storage and strict multi-user isolation via JWT — implementing all 5 Basic Level Todo features as REST API.

**Feature**: Backend API Implementation
**Branch**: 001-backend-spec-manager
**Spec**: /specs/001-backend-spec-manager/spec.md

## Implementation Strategy
Build the backend in incremental phases, starting with foundational components (setup, models, authentication) followed by individual user stories for each CRUD operation. Each phase delivers a testable increment.

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (Create Task) = Minimal working API with user isolation

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
- [US1] Create Task (Prerequisite for: [US3], [US4], [US5], [US6])
- [US2] List Tasks (Independent)
- [US3] Get Single Task (Depends on: [US1])
- [US4] Update Task (Depends on: [US1])
- [US5] Delete Task (Depends on: [US1])
- [US6] Mark as Complete (Depends on: [US1])

### Critical Path
Setup → Foundational → [US1] Create Task → [US6] Mark as Complete → Polish

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Per User Story
Each user story can be developed in parallel by different developers as they all work on the same backend/api/tasks.py file but implement different endpoints.

### Per Component Type
- Models: T010-T011 (User and Task models can be done in parallel)
- Schemas: T012-T013 (User and Task schemas can be done in parallel)
- Tests: T067-T068 (Unit and integration tests can be done in parallel)

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 standards
