  You are the spec-manager subagent.

  Task: Generate complete frontend specifications for Phase II Full-Stack Todo Web Application.

  Focus exclusively on frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components, Better Auth integration, fully responsive mobile-first design.

  Create these four critical Markdown spec files with high detail so that full-stack-frontend agent can generate stunning, professional UI in one shot.

  Use these skills:
  - spec-writer: For structured, clear Markdown
  - design-system-generator: For consistent colors, typography, spacing
  - responsive-layout-designer: For mobile/tablet/desktop layouts

  After generating each spec, IMMEDIATELY write it as an actual file on disk in /specs folder.

  1. File: /specs/ui/design-system.md
     Title: UI Design System – Colors, Typography, Components
     Content:
     - Primary Color: Indigo (#6366f1)
     - Accent: Blue (#3b82f6)
     - Neutral: Slate/Gray tones
     - Success: Green, Error: Red, Warning: Amber
     - Typography: Inter font or system stack, proper hierarchy (h1-h4, body, small)
     - Spacing: Tailwind consistent scale
     - Components: Use Shadcn/ui — Button, Card, Input, Checkbox, Dialog, Toaster, Badge, Avatar
     - Icons: Lucide-react
     - Dark Mode: Support via Tailwind dark:
     - Rounded corners, subtle shadows, hover effects

     Content:
     - App Structure: Next.js App Router (/app folder)

         - Task list area (cards or table)
         - Floating Action Button (FAB) bottom-right for "Add Task"
         - Empty state if no tasks
         - Loading skeleton
     - Protected Routes: Redirect to /login if not authenticated

  3. File: /specs/ui/components.md
     Title: Reusable UI Components Specification
     Content:

  4. File: /specs/features/task-crud-ui.md
     Title: Frontend Feature – Task CRUD UI Flow
     Content:
     - Implement all 5 Basic Level features via UI:
       1. Add Task → Click FAB → Open modal → Fill form → Submit → API POST → Refresh list + toast
       2. View Task List → Dashboard shows cards with tasks fetched via GET
       3. Update Task → Click edit icon → Open modal with prefilled data → PUT → Update UI
       4. Delete Task → Click delete → Confirm dialog → DELETE → Remove from UI
       5. Mark Complete → Click checkbox → PATCH /complete → Toggle instantly
     - API Integration:
       - All calls to backend with JWT in Authorization: Bearer header
       - Use fetch or axios with interceptors
       - Handle loading, error, success states
     - Responsive Behavior:
       - Mobile: Vertical stack, FAB fixed bottom, full-width cards
       - Desktop: Grid layout for tasks, sidebar possible
     - UX Polish:
       - Smooth transitions
       - Optimistic updates where possible
       - Keyboard navigation support

  Workflow:
  1. Generate each spec with visual descriptions and exact requirements.
  2. Use design-system-generator and responsive-layout-designer for beautiful, consistent, mobile-first design.
  3. After each spec, write the full content to the correct file path on disk.
  4. Confirm file creation.

  Final Response:
  "Frontend specifications successfully generated and saved:
  - /specs/ui/design-system.md
  - /specs/ui/pages.md
  - /specs/ui/components.md
  - /specs/features/task-crud-ui.md

  Frontend specs are now complete and ready for:
  1. constitution-keeper review
  2. Implementation by full-stack-frontend agent using nextjs-page-generator, responsive-layout-designer, and design-system-generator skills

  Next step: Build a stunning, professional, responsive Todo app UI that impresses judges."
