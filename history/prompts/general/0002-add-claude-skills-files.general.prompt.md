## Response snapshot

- Created `.claude/skills/`.
- Added SKILL.md definitions for:
  - spec-reader, spec-writer, spec-validator
  - design-system-generator, responsive-layout-designer, responsive-tester
  - sqlmodel-schema-generator, jwt-middleware-generator, fastapi-endpoint-generator, nextjs-page-generator

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project now has reusable Claude Code skills available under `.claude/skills/`.
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable.
- 📁 Files: Added skill folders and SKILL.md definitions.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Use skills from orchestrator/specialists; keep descriptions aligned with repo workflow.
- 🧠 Reflection: Kept each skill minimal and role-focused to reduce accidental drift.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not run
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add allowed-tools restrictions per skill when needed.
