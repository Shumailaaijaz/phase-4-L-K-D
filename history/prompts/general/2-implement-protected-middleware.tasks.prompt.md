# Implement Protected Middleware

## User Prompt
Please implement Task 03 from the specification: Create protected middleware for the Next.js application. This should include:

1. Create /frontend/middleware.ts with:
   - Protection for the dashboard route and other authenticated routes
   - Integration with Better Auth to verify user session
   - Proper redirect handling for unauthenticated users
   - Route matching configuration to protect specific paths
   - Proper handling of API routes vs page routes
   - Configuration that follows Next.js middleware best practices

The middleware should ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes and redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

## Response
Successfully implemented a comprehensive protected middleware for the Next.js application with the following features:

1. Protection for dashboard routes and other authenticated routes
2. Integration with Better Auth session verification using multiple possible cookie names
3. Proper redirect handling that preserves the original URL for redirect after login
4. Route matching configuration that excludes API routes, static assets, and other paths
5. Proper handling of both API routes (passed through to backend) and page routes (protected by middleware)
6. Following Next.js middleware best practices with TypeScript typing and documentation

The middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page, fulfilling all requirements from Task 03.

## Files Modified
- /mnt/d/todo-app/frontend/middleware.ts: Complete implementation of the protected middleware with Better Auth integration, proper route protection, and redirect handling

## Outcome
The middleware is now fully functional, protecting routes appropriately while maintaining proper authentication flow and user experience.
