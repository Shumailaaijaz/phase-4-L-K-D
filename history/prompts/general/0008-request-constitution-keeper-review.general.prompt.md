## Prompt

Run constitution-keeper review on backend specs

## Response snapshot

- Launched constitution-keeper compliance gate on the backend specs.
- Received verdict: REQUEST SPEC REFINEMENT.
- Key blockers identified:
  - Spec-kit structure gaps (missing feature-level spec/plan/tasks artifacts)
  - Contract drift risk: `{id}` vs `{task_id}` parameter naming mismatch
  - Auth/DB ambiguity: user identity source-of-truth (`hashed_password` vs Better Auth) and inconsistent user_id typing assumptions
  - JWT validation constraints not fully pinned down (iss/aud/alg expectations)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Compliance issues surfaced early; code generation should pause until specs are refined.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: No spec edits in this step; review output captured in prior PHR.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Apply required refinements and re-run constitution-keeper.
- 🧠 Reflection: Small spec refinements (param naming alignment + unambiguous identity model) reduce rework and prevent disqualification risks.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: drift vs authoritative contract; underspecified identity model
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not run
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Normalize endpoint param naming to `{id}` and explicitly decide canonical user_id type.
