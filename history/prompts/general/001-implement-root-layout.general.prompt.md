## Overview
Implemented Task 01 from the specification: Create the root layout for the Next.js application with proper authentication integration, API client, and responsive design.

## Files Modified/Added

- `/frontend/app/components/Navbar.tsx`
- `/frontend/app/globals.css`
- `/frontend/lib/api-client.ts`
- `/frontend/lib/error-handler.ts`

## Changes Made

### Root Layout Implementation
Created a comprehensive root layout that includes:
- Next.js 16+ App Router structure
- Inter font configuration for modern typography
- Metadata configuration with title and description
