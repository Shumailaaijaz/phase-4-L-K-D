## Prompt

Fix constitution issues and rerun review

## Response snapshot

- Created `.spec-kit/config.yaml` to satisfy Spec‑Kit requirement.
- Updated `specs/constitution.md` with:
  - explicit trailing slash rule,
  - authoritative API contract anchor (`@specs/api/contract.md`),
  - explicit 401/403/404 error semantics and JSON bodies,
  - explicit source-of-truth declaration.
- Added `specs/api/contract.md` as the authoritative contract.
- Marked `.specify/memory/constitution.md` as a non-authoritative template.
- Re-ran constitution-keeper review; verdict: **APPROVED**.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution is now enforceable and passes constitution-keeper review.
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable.
- 📁 Files: Added Spec‑Kit config + authoritative contract; tightened constitution rules.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to feature specs (task CRUD, auth flow, DB schema) under `/specs/*`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Converted ambiguous “per spec” rules into explicit, testable requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial constitution lacked enforceable contract anchoring and repo config.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not run
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add a spec-validator gate that checks for anchored contract + error semantics.
