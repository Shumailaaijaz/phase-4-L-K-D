## Prompt

Please provide the review verdict (APPROVED/REJECTED) and any remaining issues for /mnt/d/todo-app/specs/constitution.md based on the checklist in the previous prompt.

## Response snapshot

Issued VERDICT: APPROVED based on direct evidence in /specs/constitution.md, /specs/api/contract.md, and /.spec-kit/config.yaml for: spec-kit config existence, anchored authoritative API contract reference, explicit 401/403/404 semantics, explicit trailing slash rule, and clear source-of-truth statement versus .specify/memory/constitution.md.

## Outcome

- Impact: Compliance checklist confirmed; no remaining issues for the requested items.
- Tests: none
- Files: none
- Next prompts: If you want enforcement beyond specs (e.g., verify implementation matches), request a full repo compliance audit.
- Reflection: Checklist items are all explicitly stated and cross-referenced, reducing contract drift risk.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not run
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add anchored section IDs in markdown for more precise citations.
